# Wikipedia State and City Article Quality Analysis

## Goal
The goal of this project is to investigate bias in U.S. city and state Wikipedia articles. I combine a dataset of U.S. city Wikipedia articles with a dataset of state populations, and use a machine learning service called ORES to predict each article's quality. I analyze how the coverage of U.S. cities and quality of articles on Wikipedia vary among states.

## Data
Please see below for a list of datasets used in this project:

- U.S. Cities by State (*us_cities_by_state_SEPT.2023.csv*): This dataset was accessed at this [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1khouDmMaZyKo0y5WkFj4lu7g8o35x_98/view?usp=drive_link). It contains a column for *state*, *page_title*, and *url* for each article.
