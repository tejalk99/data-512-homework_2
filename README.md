# Wikipedia State and City Article Quality Analysis

## Goal
The goal of this project is to investigate bias in U.S. city and state Wikipedia articles. I combine a dataset of U.S. city Wikipedia articles with a dataset of state populations, and use a machine learning service called ORES to predict each article's quality. I analyze how the coverage of U.S. cities and quality of articles on Wikipedia vary among states.
